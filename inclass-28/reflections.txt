The Aria presentation was the most polished and well-delivered. She spoke clearly, 
loudly, and with emotion. 

The Aria presentation was the one I learned the most from. It was one of the few that
I could actually hear clearly. 

I enjoyed the Aria talk because she was the only person able to catch my attention and 
I am in support of making life easier for those with disabilities.
